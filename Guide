This guide provides instructions to set up a new React project, including creating the project, updating dependencies, cleaning up, and installing necessary packages.

In VSCode, open the terminal (PowerShell) and create a new React project:
   ```Shell
   npx create-react-app 'app name' or npx  create-react-app@^5.0.1 'app name'
1 Update package.json dependencies:
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "cra-template": "1.2.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1"
  }
}
2. Delete node_modules folder and package-lock.json file.
3. In the terminal, run the following commands one by one:
npm install
npm install web-vitals@latest
npm install svgo@2.0.0

Start the development server: npm start
